# DATATHON-2025
2025 Virginia Datathon – Team Neural Nexus This project addresses the critical question: “Where in Virginia are roads both dangerous and underserved by public transit, and how can we align transportation investments to reduce fatalities and improve access?”
Our presentation highlights three key phases:

📊 Project Overview & Slide Flow:

We begin with a heatmap visualization that identifies geospatial clusters of crash hotspots and areas with minimal transit coverage. This sets the foundation for pinpointing high-risk, underserved zones across Virginia.

Next, we dive into fatal crash trend analysis, revealing alarming year-over-year shifts in crash severity by vehicle type, especially motorcycles. These insights helped us recognize patterns in road safety risks over time.

Following that, we present a predictive model that combines crash severity scores, transit coverage, and government expenditure patterns to highlight areas where strategic intervention is most urgently needed.

The project concludes with value-driven recommendations, including data-backed safety measures, enhanced emergency response strategies, and the potential for a real-time crash risk API. Our findings aim to support cost-effective, equitable transportation planning across Virginia.

📁 Supporting Python Notebooks:

🔗 Exploratory Analysis & Visualization – Combines crash data with transit needs to identify priority zones.

🔗 Crash Trend Analysis – Tracks fatal vehicle involvement trends from 1994 to 2022.

🔗 Expenditure Review – Assesses alignment between state funding and high-risk, underserved areas.
